<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server.  That means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections.  It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP
connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
processes), automatic directory generation, and automatic file
gunzipping.  Preliminary tests show Boa is capable of
handling several thousand hits per second on a 300 MHz Pentium and
dozens of hits per second on a lowly 20 MHz 386/SX.

<p>The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security.  Security,
in the sense of <em>can't be subverted by a malicious user,</em> not
<em>fine grained access control and encrypted communications</em>. 
Boa is not intended as a feature-packed server; if you want one of those,
check out
WN (<a href="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/</a>) from John Franks. 
Modifications to Boa that improve its speed, security, robustness, and
portability, are eagerly sought.  Other features may be added if they
can be achieved without hurting the primary goals.

<p>Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips (<a href="mailto:psp@well.com">psp@well.com</a>). 
It is now being maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle
(<a href="mailto:ldoolitt@boa.org">ldoolitt@boa.org</a>) and Jon Nelson
(<a href="mailto:jnelson@boa.org">jnelson@boa.org</a>). 
Please see the acknowledgement section for further
details.

<p>GNU/Linux is the development platform at the moment, other OS's are known to work. 
If you'd like to contribute to this effort, contact Larry or Jon via e-mail.

<h2>2 Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>Boa is currently being developed and tested on GNU/Linux/i386. 
The code is straightforward (more so than most other servers),
so it should run easily on most modern Unix-alike platforms.  Recent
versions of Boa worked fine on FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.4, GNU/Linux-SPARC,
and HP-UX 9.0.  Pre-1.2.0 GNU/Linux kernels may not work because of
deficient mmap() implementations.

<h3>2.1 Installation</h3>

<ol type=1 start=1>
 <li>Unpack
<ol type=1 start=1>
  <li>Choose, and cd into, a convenient directory for the package. 
  <li><kbd>tar -xvzf boa-0.94.tar.gz</kbd>, or for those of you with an archaic
(non-GNU) tar; <kbd>gzip -cd &amp;lt; boa-0.94.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</kbd>
  <li>Read the documentation.  Really.
</ol>
 <li>Build
<ol type=1 start=1>
   <li>cd into the <tt>src</tt> directory. 
   <li>(optional) Change the default SERVER_ROOT by setting the #define
    at the top of src/defines.h
   <li>Type <kbd>./configure; make</kbd>
   <li>Report any errors to the maintainers for resolution, or strike
    out on your own.
</ol>
  <li>Configure
<ol type=1 start=1>
   <li>Choose a user and server port under which Boa can run.  The
    traditional port is 80, and user <tt>nobody</tt> (create if
    you need to) is often a good selection for security purposes. 
    If you don't have (or choose not to use) root privileges, you
    can not use port numbers less than 1024, nor can you switch user id. 
   <li>Choose a server root.  The <tt>conf</tt> directory within the
    server root must hold your copy of the configuration file
   <em>boa.conf</em>
   <li>Choose locations for log files, CGI programs (if any), and
    the base of your URL tree. 
   <li>Set the location of the <tt>mime.types</tt> file. 
   <li>Edit <em>conf/boa.conf</em> according to your
    choices above (this file documents itself).  Read through this file
    to see what other features you can configure.
</ol>
 <li>Start
<ul>
   <li>Start Boa.  If you didn't build the right SERVER_ROOT into the
    binary, you can specify it on the command line with the -c option
    (command line takes precedence).
<br><pre>    Example: ./boa -c /usr/local/boa
    </pre>
  </ul>

<li>Test
<ul>
   <li>At this point the server should run and serve documents. 
    If not, check the error_log file for clues. 
  </ul>

<li>Install
<ul>
   <li>Copy the binary to a safe place, and put the invocation into
    your system startup scripts.  Use the same -c option you used
    in your initial tests. 
  </ul>
</ol>

<br>

<h3>2.2 Files Used by Boa</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>boa.conf</code>
<dd>  This file is the sole configuration file for Boa. The directives in this
  file are defined in the DIRECTIVES section. 
<br><dt><code>mime.types</code>
<dd>  The MimeTypes &lt;filename&gt; defines what Content-Type Boa will
  send in an HTTP/1.0 or better transaction. 
  Set to /dev/null if you do not want to load a mime types file. 
  Do *not* comment out (better use AddType!) 
</dl>

<p><hr>




<br>

<h3>2.3 Compile-Time and Command-Line Options</h3>

<dl>
<dt><var>SERVER_ROOT</var>
<dt><var>-c</var>
<dd> The default server root as #defined by <var>SERVER_ROOT</var> in
 <code>defines.h</code> can be overridden on the commandline using the
 <code>-c</code> option.  The server root must hold your local copy of the
 configuration file <code>boa.conf</code>.
<br><pre>  Example: /usr/sbin/boa -c /etc/boa
 </pre>

</dl>

<p><hr>




<br>

<h3>2.4 boa.conf Directives</h3>

<p>The Boa configuration file is parsed with a lex/yacc or flex/bison
generated parser. If it reports an error, the line number will be
provided; it should be easy to spot. The syntax of each of these rules
is very simple, and they can occur in any order. Where possible, these
directives mimic those of NCSA httpd 1.3; I (Paul Phillips) saw no reason
to introduce gratuitous differences.

<p>Note: the "ServerRoot" is not in this configuration file. It can be
compiled into the server (see <code>defines.h</code>) or specified on the command
line with the <code>-c</code> option.

<p>The following directives are contained in the <code>boa.conf</code> file, and most,
but not all, are required.

<dl>
 <br><dt><code>Port &lt;Integer&gt;</code>
<dd>  This is the port that Boa runs on. The default port for http servers is 80. 
  If it is less than 1024, the server must be started as root.

<br><dt><code>Listen &lt;IP&gt;</code>
<dd>  The Internet address to bind(2) to, in quadded-octet form (numbers). 
  If you leave it out, it binds to all addresses (INADDR_ANY).

<p>The name you provide gets run through inet_aton(3), so you have to
  use dotted  quad notation.  This configuration is too important to trust some DNS.

<p>You only get one "Listen" directive,  if you want service on multiple
  IP addresses, you have three choices:

<ol type=1 start=1>
   </p><li>Run boa without a "Listen" directive:
<ul>
    <li>All addresses are treated the same; makes sense if the addresses
     are localhost, ppp, and eth0. 
    <li>Use the VirtualHost directive below to point requests to different files. 
     Should be good for a very large number of addresses (web hosting clients). 
   </ul>
    <li>Run one copy of boa per IP address:
<ul>
     <li>Each instance has its own configuration with its own
     "Listen" directive.  No big deal up to a few tens of addresses. Nice separation
     between clients. 
    </ul>

</ol>

<br><dt><code>User &lt;username or UID&gt;</code>
<dd> The name or UID the server should run as. For Boa to attempt this, the
 server must be started as root.

<br><dt><code>Group &lt;groupname or GID&gt;</code>
<dd> The group name or GID the server should run as. For Boa to attempt this,
 the server must be started as root.

<br><dt><code>ServerAdmin &lt;email address&gt;</code>
<dd> The email address where server problems should be sent. Note: this is not
 currently used.

<br><dt><code>ErrorLog &lt;filename&gt;</code>
<dd> The location of the error log file. If this does not start with /, it is
 considered relative to the server root. Set to /dev/null if you don't want
 errors logged.

<br><dt><code>AccessLog &lt;filename&gt;</code>
<dd> The location of the access log file. If this does not start with /, it is
 considered relative to the server root. Comment out or set to /dev/null
 (less effective) to disable access logging.

<br><dt><code>VerboseCGILogs</code>
<dd> This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters. Comment out to
 disable. All it does is switch on or off logging of when CGIs are launched and when
 the children return.

<br><dt><code>CgiLog &lt;filename&gt;</code>
<dd> The location of the CGI error log file.  If
 specified, this is the file that the stderr of CGIs is tied to.  Otherwise, writes
 to stderr meet the bit bucket.

<br><dt><code>ServerName &lt;server_name&gt;</code>
<dd> The name of this server that should be sent back to clients if different
 than that returned by gethostname.

<br><dt><code>VirtualHost</code>
<dd> This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters. 
 Comment out to disable. Given  DocumentRoot /var/www, requests on interface `A' or
 IP `IP-A' become /var/www/IP-A. Example: http://localhost/ becomes
 /var/www/127.0.0.1

<br><dt><code>DocumentRoot &lt;directory&gt;</code>
<dd> The root directory of the HTML documents. If this does not start with /,
 it is considered relative to the server root.

<br><dt><code>UserDir &lt;directory&gt;</code>
<dd> The name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home directory
 if a ~user request is received.

<br><dt><code>DirectoryIndex &lt;filename&gt;</code>
<dd> Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML directory index. Please
 make and use these files. On the fly creation of directory indexes
 can be slow.

<br><dt><code>DirectoryMaker &lt;full pathname to program&gt;</code>
<dd> Name of the program used
 to generate on-the-fly directory listings.  The program must take one or two
 command-line arguments, the first being the directory to index (absolute), and the
 second, which is  optional, should be the "title" of the document be. Comment out if
 you don't  want on the fly directory listings. If this  does not start with /, it is
 considered relative to the server root.

<br><dt><code>DirectoryCache &lt;directory&gt;</code>
<dd> DirectoryCache: If DirectoryIndex doesn't exist, and DirectoryMaker has been
 commented out, the the on-the-fly indexing of Boa can be used  to generate indexes
 of directories. Be warned that the output is extremely minimal and can cause
 delays when slow disks are used.  Note: The DirectoryCache must be writable by the
 same user/group that Boa runs as.

<br><dt><code>KeepAliveMax &lt;integer&gt;</code>
<dd> Number of KeepAlive requests to allow per connection. Comment out, or set
 to 0 to disable keepalive processing.

<br><dt><code>KeepAliveTimeout &lt;integer&gt;</code>
<dd> Number of seconds to wait before keepalive connections time out.

<br><dt><code>MimeTypes &lt;file&gt;</code>
<dd> The location of the mime.types file. If this does not start with /, it is
 considered relative to the server root. 
 Comment out to avoid loading mime.types (better use AddType!)

<br><dt><code>DefaultType &lt;mime type&gt;</code>
<dd> MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there is no file
 extension.

<br><dt><code>AddType &lt;mime type&gt; &lt;extension&gt; extension...</code>
<dd> Associates a MIME type
 with an extension or extensions.

<br><dt><code>Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias</code>
<dd> Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -
 they match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action. 
 Use Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and
 ScriptAlias to enable directories for script execution.

<br><dt><code>Redirect &lt;path1&gt; &lt;path2&gt;</code>
<dd>  allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist
  in your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you
  tell the clients where to look for the relocated document.

<br><dt><code>Alias &lt;path1&gt; &lt;path2&gt;</code>
<dd>  aliases one path to another. Of course, symbolic links in the
  file system work fine too.

<br><dt><code>ScriptAlias &lt;path1&gt; &lt;path2&gt;</code>
<dd>  maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts.

<h3>2.5 Security</h3>

<p>Boa has been designed to use the existing file system security.   In
<code>boa.conf</code>, the directives <em>user</em> and
<em>group</em> determine who Boa will run as, if launched by root. 
By default, the user/group is nobody/nogroup.  This allows quite a bit
of flexibility.  For example, if you want to disallow access to otherwise
accessible directories or files, simply make them inaccessible to
nobody/nogroup. If the user that Boa runs as is "boa" and the groups that
"boa" belongs to include "web-stuff" then files/directories accessible
by users with group "web-stuff" will also be accessible to Boa.

<p>The February 2000 hoo-rah from
<a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html">CERT advisory CA-2000-02</a>
has little to do with Boa.  As of version 0.94.4, Boa's escaping rules have
been cleaned up a little, but they weren't that bad before.  The example CGI
programs have been updated to show what effort is needed there.  If you
write, maintain, or use CGI programs under Boa (or any other server) it's
worth your while to read and understand this advisory.  The real problem,
however, boils down to browser and web page designers emphasizing frills
over content and security.  The market leading browsers assume (incorrectly)
that all web pages are trustworthy.

<p><hr>




<br>

<h2>3 Limits and Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>There are many issues that become more difficult to resolve in a single
tasking web server than in the normal forking model.  Here is a partial
list - there are probably others that haven't been encountered yet.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Limits">Limits</a>: 
<li><a href="#Differences%20between%20Boa%20and%20other%20web%20servers">Differences between Boa and other web servers</a>: 
<li><a href="#Unexpected%20Behavior">Unexpected Behavior</a>: 
</ul>

<p><hr>



<br>

<h3>3.1 Limits</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Slow file systems

<p>The file systems being served should be much faster than the
 network connection to the HTTP requests, or performance will suffer. 
 For instance, if a document is served from a CD-ROM, the whole server
 (including all other currently incomplete data transfers) will stall
 while the CD-ROM spins up.  This is a consequence of the fact that Boa
 mmap()'s each file being served, and lets the kernel read and cache
 pages as best it knows how.  When the files come from a local disk
 (the faster the better), this is no problem, and in fact delivers
 nearly ideal performance under heavy load.  Avoid serving documents
 from NFS and CD-ROM unless you have even slower inbound net
 connections (e.g., POTS SLIP).

</p><li>DNS lookups

<p>Writing a nonblocking gethostbyaddr is a difficult and not very
 enjoyable task.  Paul Phillips experimented with several methods,
 including a separate logging process, before removing hostname
 lookups entirely. There is a companion program with Boa
 <code>util/resolver.pl</code> that will postprocess the logfiles and
 replace IP addresses with hostnames, which is much faster no matter
 what sort of server you run.

</p><li>Identd lookups

<p>Same difficulties as hostname lookups; not included. 
 Boa provides a REMOTE_PORT environment variable, in addition
 to REMOTE_ADDR, so that a CGI program can do its own ident. 
 See the end of <tt>examples/cgi-test.cgi</tt>.

</p><li>Password file lookups via NIS

<p>If users are allowed to serve HTML from their home directories,
 password file lookups can potentially block the process.  To lessen
 the impact, each user's home directory is cached by Boa so it need
 only be looked up once.

</p><li>Running out of file descriptors

<p>Since a file descriptor is needed for every ongoing connection
 (two for non-nph CGIs, directories, and automatic gunzipping of files),
 it is possible though highly improbable to run out of file
 descriptors.  The symptoms of this conditions may vary with
 your particular unix variant, but you will probably see log
 entries giving an error message for <tt>accept</tt>. 
 Try to build your kernel to give an adequate number for
 your usage - GNU/Linux provides 256 out of the box, more than
 enough for most people. 
</ul>

<p><hr>




<br>

<h3>3.2 Differences between Boa and other web servers</h3>

<p>In the pursuit of speed and simplicity, some aspects of Boa differ
from the popular web servers.  In no particular order:

<ul>
 <li><var>REMOTE_HOST</var> environment variable not set for CGI programs

<p>The <var>REMOTE_HOST</var> environment variable is not set for CGI programs,
  for reasons already described.  This is easily worked around because the
  IP address is provided in the <var>REMOTE_HOST</var> variable, so (if the CGI
  program actually cares) gethostbyaddr or a variant can be used.

</p><li>There are no server side includes (<small>SSI</small>) in Boa

<p>We don't like them, and they are too slow to parse.  We will consider
  more efficient alternatives.

</p><li>There are no access control features

<p>Boa will follow symbolic links, and serve any file that it can
  read.  The expectation is that you will configure Boa to run as user
  "nobody", and only files configured world readable will come
  out.

</p><li>No chroot option

<p>There is no option to run chrooted.  If anybody wants this, and is
  willing to try out experimental code, contact the maintainers. 
</ul>

<p><hr>



<br>

<h3>3.3 Unexpected Behavior</h3>

<ul>
 <li>SIGHUP handling

<p>Like any good server, Boa traps SIGHUP and rereads <code>boa.conf</code>. 
 However, under normal circumstances, it has already given away
 permissions, so many items listed in <code>boa.conf</code> can not take effect. 
 No attempt is made to change uid, gid, log files, or server port. 
 All other configuration changes should take place smoothly.

</p><li>Relative URL handling

<p>Not all browsers handle relative URLs correctly.  Boa will not
 cover up for this browser bug, and will typically report 404 Not Found
 for URL's containing odd combinations of "../" 's.

<p>Note: As of version 0.95.0 (unreleased) the URL parser has been
 rewritten and *does* correctly handle relative URLs. 
</ul>

 <br> <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/</a>

<li>Roxen: based on ulpc interpreter, non-forking (interpreter implements
 threading), GPL'd
 <br> <a href="http://www.roxen.com/">http://www.roxen.com/</a>

<li>WN: featureful, GPL'd
 <br> <a href="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/</a>

<li>Apache: fast, PD
 <br> <a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>

<li>NCSA: standard, legal status? 
 <br> <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/</a>

<li>CERN: standard, PD, supports proxy
 <br> <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/Status.html">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/Status.html</a>

<li>xs-httpd 2.0: small, fast, pseudo-GPL'd
 <br> <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~sven/xs-httpd/">http://www.stack.nl/~sven/xs-httpd/</a>

<li>bozohttpd.tar.gz sources, in perl
 <br> <a href="ftp://ftp.eterna.com.au/bozo/bsf/attware/bozohttpd.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.eterna.com.au/bozo/bsf/attware/bozohttpd.tar.gz</a>

<li>Squid is actually an "Internet Object Cache"
 <br> <a href="http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/">http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/</a>
</ul>

<p>Also worth mentioning is Zeus. 
It is commercial, with a free demo, so it doesn't belong on the list above. 
Zeus seems to be based on technology similar to Boa and thttpd,
but with more bells and whistles.
