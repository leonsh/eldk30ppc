Future Development</A>

<P>
Today's kernel NFS server is very much usable, but it not perfect.
People are working on further improvements.

<P>

<UL><LI>The current stable Linux kernel only supports NFS over UDP. We
  	like to get NFS over TCP stabilized.

<P>

<LI>We are also working on support for the NFS Version 3 protocol.

<P>

<LI>As we mentioned above, rename or move a file to a different
  	directory on the same file system still causes the change in
	the file handle. We'd like to address it in the future
	development.
	
	One proposal looks very promising. That is make
	the mapping between file and file handle be part of the
	VFS layer. Each file system will provide a conversion between
	a file and a file handle, which is persistent between server
	reboots as well as
	independent of its pathnames as well as its parent directory
	pathnames. It also solves the problem where the underlying
	file systems
	do not support all the fields in the current file handle 
	format.
