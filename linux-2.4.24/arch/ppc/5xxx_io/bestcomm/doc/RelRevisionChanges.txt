Changes in BestComm API between Release 1.0 and 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Sep 25, 2003

- Added TasksAttachImage() function.

- Added TasksSetSramOffset() and TasksGetSramOffset() functions.

- Added example code for systems using virtual memory.

- Changed some defines for the GUI development specification.

- Added awareness of virtual memory address translation in operating systems
  such as QNX Neutrino.  This required a new function called TasksInitAPI_VM().
  TasksInitAPI() takes two addresses as parameters. One is the virtual
  address and the other is the physical address of the processor's register
  map. This must be mapped as cache-protected device memory, and must map the
  entire register range including the internal SRAM.

- TaskBDAssign() should no longer set buffer length to 0 for receive tasks. When
  calling this function in version 1.1 and later, set to the buffer length parameter
  to the maximum size (in bytes) of the receive buffer.
